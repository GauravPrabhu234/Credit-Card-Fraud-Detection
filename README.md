# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

**This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains a large number of transactions, including a small percentage of fraud cases. The main goal is to build an effective model that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of different classification algorithms.**

**In this project , first we differentiated the data sets into 0 and 1. 0 indicates the legit transaction and 1 indicates the fraudulent transactions  and made a new dataset named as legit sample and predicted the accuracy scores.**
